## Meme Drive

This repository is a side project to create a means to generate memes to the frontend. I is based on Arweave, this is beacuse photos or pictures are uploaded on Arweave with tags and they can be queuried with Bundlr.

## How it works

- User entires a tag for example "congratulations" on the frontend
- An exhaustive list of pictures with tag congratulations is displayed to frontend
- User can dowload the picture or Meme
- Another option exist for users to add text over the pictures and download

## Motivation

My Motivation is to build something thagt demonstrate the data permanence that Arweave brings to the web3 ecosysytem.
